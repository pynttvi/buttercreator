this spell incessant. The suffocating billow of miasma disappears as
fast as it was created, leaving the stronger enemies only slightly

said that the knowledge of this spell enhances the amount of time

of bioluminescence. This has its advantages in both delving in the
darkness as well as making the invoker all the more approachable.

can't be stacked and the knight has to recover from the previous cast
before he can cast it again. The recovery time depends on the power of

Using this spell the knight can create a cube of pure chaos energy
which will be impassable from both sides to everyone else but the
knight who can exit it from the inside. This spell has two uses, it
can be used as a refuge place for the knight or it can be used to imprison

according to its intelligence and level. The duration of the cube depends
on wis, spell % and skill % of mastery of death protection. The cube can be
broken at any time by the caster with a command 'break_cube'. Due to
the heavy stress caused by handling large amounts of chaos materia this
spell can't be casted all the time. The investigations of chaos materia
suggest that all materia of another type except living or dead tissue
will be destroyed if in contact with the materia when the cube collapses,
hence the cube shouldn't be used as a weapon/armour storage.
Note: certain monsters with special teleportation abilities are known
have escaped the chaos cubes.
Additional note: Very large monsters are almost immune to cubing.

Help on spell: Drain power

Help on spell: Draining mine
Casting time:  5 rounds
Spell cost:    36 SPs
Spell type:    neutral
Spell words:   Driel amuras drakka

This spell will summon a highly unstable and partly organic concentration
of chaos magic which will drain magical and physical energy from living
creatures around it. When the mine reaches it maximum draining capacity
it will self-destruct and move all the energy it has accumulated to the
knight, if the knight is still in the realm. Mine can also be released
instantly by knight and used (for example) as a direct assault tool.
Wisdom, spell percent and amount of death points affect the speed of
the draining. The amount the mine can drain before it comes too unstable
to stay in this realm is dependant on the knights wis, spell %, amount
of death points and mastery of draining.
Note: if the knight isn't in the realm when the mine discharges he
wont gain any energy. Those who serve the greater plan of the
God of death (death knights and necromancers) have a greater chance
of seeing the mine. Exceptionally, this type of illusion can also
occasionally be seen by a sorcerer, due to its partly organic nature.
                                                                     
Note: Not more than one of these mines can be placed in a room and not
more than one casted by the same knight can exist simultaneously. The
mine will try to survive, so it will fight if attacked by someone.
There are some unknown complications on trying to kill organically
evolving centers of chaos magic. For example, they are sometimes known
to spawn supracreatures of themselves when under stress. These supracreatures
exhibit evolved behaviour. Draining mines can be attacked by anyone
even if not seen, but this can sometimes prove difficult to some as
draining mines seem to learn.
                                                                  
Note: Mastery of death illusions vs the comparing mastery of death
illusions affects the chance that others than the knight who casted
the spell will see the draining mine.
                                                                 
Note: Due to the partly organic nature of mines, they evolve and
multiply over time. Mines that are grouped close to each other tend
to migrate to one spot due to group mentality. In some cases they
acquire advanced behaviour due to grouping. When they migrate to one spot,
they also multiply faster. This can cause an overload of chaos magic in an
area, which leads to self-destruction of draining mines in an chaos
magic explosion, which has unknown effects.
Note: The knight has a chance of estimating the release time of the
mine. The accuracy of the estimation depends on his mastery of draining.
                                                                   
Note: Those who are drained will receive no information that their
energy is sapped due to death illusionic nature of the spell. It will
seem to those who are drained that they are losing no energy at all
and their true condition will be revealed to them only at a later date
when they move far enough from the concentration of the illusion. This
fact makes it extremely hard to predict the location of a draining mine(s).
Mastery of death illusions affects the length of time it takes for an
illusion of this sort to lift from those, who have been in contact with a
mine or a group of mines. Also longer exposure times can cause a considerable
loss of energy, which in turn leads to a extended period of illness in those
who fail a saving throw against them.
                                                                 
Note: Mines also have unpredictable behaviour, which chaos theorians of
death knights have been unable to model although this has been studied
to great extent. New properties which arise seems to be of emergent sort
and this causes the mines to exhibit advanced behaviour under different laws
of higher energy. These emergent properties show across new concentrations,
meaning that previous concentrations seem to 'transfer' some of their knowledge
to new concentrations before they self-destruct, are drained by the
knight who created them or are otherwise destroyed. According to chaos
theorists, this means that chaos concentrations are evolving over time.

Help on spell: Elemental disarray
Casting time:  8 rounds
Spell cost:    342 SPs
Spell type:    attack
Spell words:   nequam victus confundo mentis

Abjuration has come a long way since the first days of trial 
and error with vulnerability magic. Research has yielded 
a potentially more efficient way to use time and mana to 
weaken a foe. Created by the elite of the Abjurers, this 
spell involves manipulating the essence in a living being. At 
first painstaking experiments in this form of magic were an 
utter failure, but through a significant breakthrough in
sorcery brought about by the second coming of the Sorcerers, 
a series of successful invocations were made. With this spell, 
the abjurer uses runic magic to disturb the elements of the 
victim, causing increased susceptability against cold, 
magical, fire, physical and asphyxiating attacks.

Help on spell:   Empyreal bastion
Casting time:    6 rounds
Spell cost:      520 SPs
Spell type:      defensive
Spell words:     auream empirii pallum
Affecting stats: charisma, constitution, wisdom and transfer control

The members of the Golden Company excel in protecting themselves from
harm during their adventures. As they are mercenarial by nature, they
can sometimes meet other adventurers from different guilds or races and
strike up necessary alliances with them should it be required by the task
at hand. Some allies may even take it unto themselves to lead and to take
the position at the vanguard against enemies or other dangerous creatures.
Yet, a well-studied member of the Golden Company may still use their
prodigial survival prowess by utilizing the Golden Art of the Empyreal
Bastion. This will allow the invoker to project a defensive aura similar
to the Golden Mantle, but provide it for all the allies in the room, with
a slightly greater cost and a somewhat diminished capacity. The Arts
mentioned above will not work simultaneously with one another.
The empyreal bastion will greatly hinder the casters ability to sustain
damage in melee combat.

Once the performance of this Art begins, the invoker will lose a part of
their regenerative powers indefinitely, or until the invoker chooses to
end the performance.

Help on spell: Flash of power
Casting time:  10 rounds
Spell cost:    1768 SPs
Spell type:    attack
Spell words:   Magica fulminatus!

This spell cannot be tumbled.


The high mages of old have long known the existance of Shards. Likewise,
they are aware of the Shards' tendency to appear where a great power leaves
this plane of existance. According to the bibliographical information
gathered by Cemreet from the last hundred and fifty years, the chance of
discovering a Shard of the Gods is much greater when the magical items of
the deceased have had their bonds unspooled before the owner dies.

The precise reason for this is unknown, but the Council of the Mage Guild
speculates that the alteration of powerful magical equipment releases
awesome amounts of magical energy. This energy then attracts more power to
the site of combat.

Flash of Power is relatively crude spell designed to boost this effect. The
combined power of three mages is used to overload the magical equipment
carried by a creature. The process replaces the magical bonds that would
otherwise create an affinity between these objects and their owners with a
powerful negative energy that repels these individuals instead. In so doing,
it displaces a large amount of magical energy, greatly increasing the chance
and power, and even affecting the type, of an appearing Shard. This usually
angers the target, and unleashes a cloud of fractured magical energy that
has unpredictable effects.

Help on spell: Flesh rot
Casting time:  4 rounds
Spell cost:    278 SPs
Spell type:    attack
Damage type:   magical
Spell words:   Plaguras zaram death shakaram

With this spell the death knight calls the forces of death and plague
over the enemy, virtually making the targets flesh rot instantly and
causing great pain. If the knight eats the pieces of flesh from the
targets body he will gain some of the lifeforce stored in them.
This spell can restore a greater deal of the knights lifeforce than
suffocation, but its ability to replenish vigour or mana is weaker.
If either of the two (target/caster) move, the bond between them will
be broken. The damage this spell does to the target and the amount of
lifeforce the knight will gain depends on the spell %, mastery 
of draining %,
intelligence and amount of death points the knight possesses. It is possible
for the bond to stay on even after it no longer provides the knight for
additional power.

Help on spell:   Golden dawn
Casting time:    5 rounds
Spell cost:      607 SPs
Spell type:      defensive
Spell words:     auream dilucilio ordo
Affecting stats: constitution, wisdom, inner power, stun resistance and lion's
                 heart

As the sun rises in the dawn of a new day, equally irrevocable is the
dogged determination of a learned invoker of the Golden Company.
Whereas usually concentration manipulation magics seek to alter the
electrical currents that transmit information within the brain,
the Art of the Golden Dawn uses druidic matter manipulation in
conjunction with the surgical precision of the healers to adjust the
very structure of ones skull, making it near impervious to knockout
blows. However, should the person be under the influence of the
traditional spells that bolster ones concentration, performing this
Art will not be possible.

Once the performance of this Art begins, the invoker will lose a part
of their regenerative powers indefinitely, or until the invoker chooses
to end the performance.

Help on spell:   Golden mantle
Casting time:    6 rounds
Spell cost:      693 SPs
Spell type:      defensive
Spell words:     amictu im auream
Affecting stats: charisma, constitution, armour of god, brew salve of physical
                 resistance, life beyond death and barkskin

Through an ingenious combination of galactic gravitational manipulation
and the harnessing of stellar energies, the Golden Company has been able
to improve upon the godly protection given by the spell 'armour of god'
and the mastery over living matter of the druidic spells and the natural
abjuration of the spell 'barkskin'. The resulting protective enhancement
is thus known as the Golden Mantle, name of which becomes self evident as
the invoker conjures the Art and is soon enveloped by a fiery golden
shroud, which will deter  attacks of both physical and elemental nature.
The Art of Golden Mantle is not compatible with that of the Empyreal
Bastion.

Once the performance of this Art begins, the invoker will lose a part of
their regenerative powers indefinitely, or until the invoker chooses to
end the performance.

Help on spell:   Golden meteor
Casting time:    5 rounds

Spell words:     aurum bothnya controqueo
Affecting stats: charisma, wisdom, spell percent, fire lore, sun lore, meteor
                 storm and meteor blast

The objects that travel the cosmos do so at an incredible velocity. The
Golden Company, after countless aeons of studies, figured out to harness
this kinetic energy and to combine its ferocity with the malleable, yet
dense weight of gold. The combined destructive force of a celestial object
striking the ground, fragmenting and slinging dense, fiery fragments into
the environment is devastating. The Art of Golden Meteor may not be used
together with the Art of Rain of Stars.

Once this Art is invoked, the environment of the invoker will be bombarded
intermittently with destructive golden meteors.

Once the performance of this Art begins, the invoker will lose a part of
their regenerative powers indefinitely, or until the invoker chooses to
end the performance.

The Golden Meteor will only strike at targets when invoked outdoors.

Help on spell: Grave stench
Casting time:  4 rounds
Spell cost:    75 SPs
Spell type:    neutral
Spell words:   Hcnets u'h horr

This spell can only be casted on objects. When cast it will form a
powerful illusion around the object. The illusion will not affect
on how the item appears, but instead it will affect the smell of the
item. Everyone but the caster of the spell will perceive the smell as
a horrible stench of rotten flesh and blood, hence being unable to go
near the item, much less pick it up. The duration of the illusion depends
on wisdom, spell % and mastery of death illusions.

Maximum damage: 101
Spell words:    Friozes iazes brr

temperature of 0C. The casting of this spell requires the body of
the caster to reach the temperature of -10C temporarily in order to
enhance the amount of damage it does. When the spell is cast an extremely
cold mist appears in front of the caster and everyone caught inside
the mist suffer cold damage. Those inside the mist can get partially
frozen and therefore be unable to act for few seconds. The affecting
stats are int, wis, spell percent, skill percent of channel death magic and
amount of death points the knight possesses. Targets get a saving throw
against the freezing affect according to their constitution.

Spell words:     om anima invictium
Affecting stats: charisma, constitution, wisdom, regeneration, mastery of
                 medicine, true unpain, breath of life and purity of spirit

The Golden Arts are often associated with softer techniques and attributes
such as wisdom, or charisma and the members of the Golden Company usually
practice similar arts in their day-to-day life, being druids, healers or
something similar. Unfortunately, sometimes this kind of approach is
not the correct one. When met with savagery and brutality, sometimes
one must fight fire with fire. For this purpose exists the Art of the
Indomitable Spirit, with which softer attributes can be transformed
into the physical force manifestation that is required.

Once the performance of this Art begins, the invoker will lose a part of
their regenerative powers indefinitely, or until the invoker chooses to
end the performance.

Help on spell: Jigoku blade
Casting time:  4 rounds
Spell cost:    267 SPs

Spell words:   daimio ghooor moooooor goooood

Jigoku Blade is a blade enchantment used by the Samurai to inflict
additional damage on the forces of good and it has no effect on
creatures of other alignment. While this blade enchantment has a great
potential to damage, some aspects of the Jigoku Blade spell narrow its
use. The effective use of the Jigoku Blade enchantment requires
substantial mastery of his weapon, and the alignment of the enemy heavily
reflects on the damage inflicted.

Jigoku blade will remain active indefinitely after casting, gradually
draining spell points for maintenance.  To end it at any time, type
'jigoku_off'.

based on magic, but also calls upon nature. When successful, the caster
creates a portal into the ground, reaching a nearby active volcano.
With a sudden burst a stream of hot lava, glowing rocks and ash erupts
from the portal. Pity your foe, for it is about to be hit by glowing
magma which is filling up the whole area very quickly. Once hit the
lava begins to dissolve your enemy, setting it alight and finally
incinerating it. You would propably share its fait, but luckily you
create a very powerful shield that protects you and your allies from
this ferocius spell.

Help on spell:  Lightbringer
Casting time:   4 rounds
Spell cost:     693 SPs
Spell type:     neutral
Spell words:    venusiam offerto lux
Affecting stat: charisma

As the power of the closest star, the Sun, diminishes during the night,
the Golden Company loses a vast part of its primary source of energy
which fuels their Golden Arts. To counter this, they have devised a
technique which allows the invoker to turn inwards in search of a
golden, guiding light. The Art of Lightbringer is quite taxing to the
caster, but will, with sufficient skill be able to counteract almost
all the 
negative effects otherwise suffered in the practice of the Arts
during the darkest of nights. While inherently defensive in nature,
the Art of the Lightbringer is unique in that it counts as both: a
defensive and an offensive aura when performed.

Once the performance of this Art begins, the invoker will lose a part of
their regenerative powers indefinitely, or until the invoker chooses to
end the performance.

Spell words:     addustio iubar
Affecting stats: charisma and wisdom

To lead from the front. To become an unstoppable, inevitable force
that will illuminate even the darkest reaches of the realm. This,
among many others, is one of the core tenets of the Golden Company.
By harnessing the radiance of a vibrant star, a member of the Golden
Company will become much more harder to target, thus increasing their
chance against any manner of creatures of the dark or elsewhere. The
power of the radiant glow has also been known to reinforce some aspects
of fire-related Arts performed simultanously.

Spell words:     adstrum pluvia
Affecting stats: wisdom, charisma, spell percent, astronomy, missile storm,
                 cloudburst and camping

Where the Golden Art of 'Starshards' concentrates an assault of
stellar energy against a smallish target, this Art takes all the fury
but imposes over it much less control, thus making the entire area
subject to the stellar rain. The lowered control requirements will allow
the invoker to create a proportionally greater annihilation in terms of
relative mental acuity spent on controlling each individual miniscule
star. The Art of Rain of Stars may not be used simultaneously with the
Art of Golden Meteor.

rained on by thousands of tiny stars.

The Golden Art of Solar Flare was among the first ever invented by
the invokers of the Golden Company. Even to this day, the means of
energy traversal for this spell are not completely known, be they
Planar or dimensional in nature. This lack of knowledge does not
seem to have had an impact on the Arts ability to transfer an
fearsome amount of solar power through the invoking process.

Once this Art is invoked, the target of the invoker will be occasionally
struck by a giant eruption of solar energy, also known as a flare.

Once the performance of this Art begins, the invoker will lose a part of
their regenerative powers indefinitely, or until the invoker chooses to
end the performance.

The Solar Flare will only strike at targets when invoked outdoors.

are equally affected with the living, for their soul is still fully present
in this realm.

Help on spell:   Starburst
Casting time:    5 rounds
Spell cost:      650 SPs
Spell type:      offensive
Spell words:     frago procurso sidus
Affecting stats: charisma, wisdom, spell percent, dexterity, shield fighting,
                 shield techniques and elemental mastery

The powers contained in the cosmos are not all observable. There are
ways for the stars to destroy without force or fire. One of these
invisible killers is radiation, more commonly known as the warmth
one feels on a sunny day. But in large amounts, this radiation can be
extremely deadly. By using their shield as a focal point, an invoker
of the Golden Company can push this focused radiation outward, towards
the oblivious recipient. To focus radiation without harming oneself,
the invoker must be wearing a shield. The damage type of this invocation
can be altered by the invoker wielding a weapon of the preferred type.

Once this Art is invoked, the target of the invoker will be on occasion
subjected to pulses of intense cosmic radiation.

Once the performance of this Art begins, the invoker will lose a part of
their regenerative powers indefinitely, or until the invoker chooses to
end the performance.

Help on spell:   Starcore
Casting time:    5 rounds

Spell words:     summam stella procurso
Affecting stats: charisma, wisdom, spell percent, mastery of medicine, stunning
                 blow, fragile frame, mathematics, anatomy and molecular
                 agitation

Manipulation of astral energies is largely dependent on the amount of
energy harnessed and the control imposed upon that energy. While many
invokers tend to favor the less intensive Golden Arts, some may, at
times, need a more contained approach. With this Art, an invoker
is able to exert force in an incredibly precise way, forcing it
to manifest inside the target and attack it from within.

Once this Art is invoked, microscopic stars will on occasion form,
collapse and erupt within the target of the invoker.

Once the performance of this Art begins, the invoker will lose a part of
their regenerative powers indefinitely, or until the invoker chooses to
end the performance.

Help on spell:   Starlight crescent
Casting time:    12 rounds
Spell cost:      253 SPs
Spell type:      enchantment
Spell words:     crescendum infinit cosmico
Affecting stats: charisma, constitution, wisdom, harmony armour, transfer control
                 and grace of god or will of god or hand of god

Invoking astral powers is easy, but can easily overwhelm an untrained
mind. For the Golden Company to excel, a spell was required for the
members to better prepare against clashes with the undead legions of
Mordiggian. By casting and controlling the energies with this spell,
a seasoned invoker is able to enchant and manipulate their already
magical armament with power drawn from the incalculable mysteries of
cosmos. Ultimately, with this enchantment a member of the Golden
Company may be able to wield a weapon of pure sorcery.

Help on spell:   Starshards
Casting time:    5 rounds
Spell cost:      650 SPs

Spell words:     luculentii admis inlustrato
Affecting stats: wisdom, charisma, spell percent, mystifying flourish,
                 scattershot, chaos theory, quick shot, fast blow and magic
                 missile

Even the most basic scholarly neophytes in the realm know that the vast
majority of the observable universe is nothing but an incredibly empty
void. There are, however, many types of energies flowing in that black
nothingness if you know where to look. An experienced invoker can focus
on, manipulate, and manifest some of these energies as deadly projectiles
known as starshards.

Once this Art is invoked, the target of the invoker will be intermittently
assaulted by speeding, celestial starshards.

Once the performance of this Art begins, the invoker will lose a part of
their regenerative powers indefinitely, or until the invoker chooses to
end the performance.

Help on spell: Suffocation
Casting time:  4 rounds
Spell cost:    274 SPs
Spell type:    attack
Damage type:   asphyxiation
Spell words:   Haer haer sharakam dasta

This spell is often used by death knights who wish to strenghten 
themselves with the lifeforce of other people. It will form a magical 
band around the targets neck which will then keep draining his magical 
and physical energy, transfering it to the knight and at the same time 
tightening around the targets neck, choking him. The bond between the 
target and the knight will last until the target chokes and dies, 
target moves too far from the knight for the knight to be able to 
maintain the bond, the knight moves or the bond runs out of power. The 
damage this spell does to the target and the amount of magical and 
physical energy which the knight will gain depend on int, wis spell %, 
skill % of mastery of draining and the amount of death points the 
knight possesses. The amount of magical energy contained in the armour 
worn by the death knight also affects the power of the spell to a 
great degree. The targets resistance to asphyxiation also affects the 
amount of power actually granted to the death knight from the drains. 
The amount of rooms the target needs to move before he is free from 
the bond depends on the wisdom of the knight. This spell works 
differently on monsters and players. It is possible for the bond to 
stay on even after it no longer provides the knight for additional 
power.

Spell cost:     102 SPs
Spell type:     area attack
Damage type:    cold
Maximum damage: 416
Spell words:    Iiaca brr amny icem

The casting of this spell is very dangerous to the caster. In order
to succeed the casters' body needs to reach a temperature so low that
it can actually harm him. That is probably why only certain ice demons,
few intelligent yetis and few other creatures of cold terrains have
been known to cast this spell. When succesful the spell will create
what appears as icicles on the tips of the casters' fingers and then
a magical force will shoot these icicles towards the targets with
incredible speed. What a non-magical people won't see though is that
these icicles are actually very powerful rays of cold which will freeze
important bodyparts on the designated targets.

Help on spell: Summon orb of reflection
Casting time:  5 rounds
Spell cost:    264 SPs
Spell type:    defensive
Spell words:   Kra's dras shaidon

This spell will allow the death knight to call forth a orb of reflection
from the chaos-continuum. The orb will sometimes reflect offensive spells
directed at the knight at a random person in the room of the knight. The
effectiveness of this spell depends on int, spell %, skill % of mastery
of death protection and total amount of death points the knight possesses.
The duration of the orb is dependant on wis of the caster.
Important side note from many esteemed death knights suggest that due
to the chaotic nature of the orb it will violently explode if it comes
into contact with other materia from the chaos-continuum. The orb will
drain mental energy from its master in order to maintain itself.
The caster can banish the orb with a command 'banish_orb'.

Help on spell: Summon shadow

This spell will summon a creature called shadow lurker which can't be
seen by anyone except the servants of death, i.e necromancers and death
knights. When casting this spell the knight will specify a direction
and a password to the lurker. The lurker will guard the way to that
direction and if someone passes to that direction it will alert its
master, unless the password is spoken in the same room with the lurker.

spell % and skill % of mastery of death protection.
Note: The lurker can be attacked by others even if it can't be seen.
If the lurker takes damage from the attack it will turn visible and
try to save itself before it is killed by sinking through the ground
back to its realm. The knight can dismiss the lurker at any given time
with a command 'dismiss_lurker'.

Tenrai Blade is a blade enchantment used by the Samurai to inflict
additional damage on the forces of evil and it has no effect on
creatures of other alignment. While this blade enchantment has a great
potential to damage, some aspects of the Tenrai Blade spell narrow its
use. The effective use of the Tenrai Blade enchantment requires
substantial mastery of his weapon, and the alignment of the enemy heavily
reflects on the damage inflicted.

Tenrai blade will remain active indefinitely after casting, gradually
draining spell points for maintenance.  To end it at any time, type
