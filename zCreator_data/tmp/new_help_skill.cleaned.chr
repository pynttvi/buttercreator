The blood of ancient warriors flows in your veins. Their spirits walk beside
you, watching over their descendants with pride. Through deep communion with
these ancestral souls, you can call upon their wisdom and strength to guide
your hand in battle.
When you invoke this ancient rite, the spirits of your forebears manifest
around you - not as ghosts, but as echoes of will and power that merge with
your own. Their battle-hardened instincts guide your strikes with supernatural
precision and speed.
This is the essence of the Savage path - you do not fight alone. You carry
the strength of generations, and when you call, they answer.
Using this skill costs three points of fury.

Help on skill:  Ancestral leap
Usage duration: random
Fatigue:        low
Skill type:     misc
An ancient primal technique passed down through countless generations
of barbarian warriors. By calling upon ancestral spirits and tapping
into the primal bonds that connect all barbarians to sacred places,
a warrior can leap through the spirit realm itself, emerging at
locations infused with tribal power.
The technique requires immense physical and spiritual energy, as the
warrior must forcefully tear open a path through the veil between
worlds. Only places deeply bound to barbarian heritage - guild halls,
ancient battlegrounds, ritual sites - resonate strongly enough to
serve as anchors for this journey.
Skilled warriors can also sense the spiritual echoes of other living
souls, allowing them to tear through reality itself to reach distant
allies or enemies. The spirits care not for distance - only that the
barbarian's will is strong enough to breach the boundaries between
here and there.

Through sacred ancestral rites, the barbarian performs a ritual send-off for
fallen enemies, honoring their warrior spirit and sending their soul to join
the ancestors. This act of respect for worthy foes draws upon ancient spirits
to bless the barbarian with renewed vitality, restoring both health and vigor
while gaining the favor of those who watch from beyond.
The ritual requires significant spiritual energy and can only be performed upon
the corpse of a slain enemy. The greater the fallen warrior, the more potent
the blessing received.

Skill type:        passive
Affecting stat(s): strength and skill percent
Some believe dexterity to be the sole provider of speed, but these fools
have not witnessed the primal fury of a charging rhino or the explosive
power of a striking bear. A well-trained barbarian, despite being a
towering colossus of scars and muscle, can move in short bursts with such
violent alacrity that onlookers mistake it for witchcraft when in
reality it is simply pure, unbridled strength.
Where others rely on nimble footwork and careful positioning, a barbarian
has learned to explode into motion through raw muscular power. Their massive
frame doesn't gracefully sidestep danger but erupts away from it, driven
by the same explosive force that propels an apex predator into its strike.
Each evasive movement is less a dodge and more a controlled detonation of
strength, the body launching itself clear of harm through sheer physical
might rather than agility.
This is not the measured dance of a duelist. This is the terrifying burst
of a warhorse changing direction, the sudden lunge of a great cat: brutal,
overwhelming, and devastatingly effective.

The blood calls. Not metaphorically, not symbolically - your own blood,
ancient and knowing, demands to be spilled. The civilized recoil from
self-inflicted wounds, calling it madness. They understand nothing of
power written in scars, of strength purchased with sacrifice.
You tear open old wounds or carve new ones, letting your blood flow free.
As crimson streams down your body, something awakens - the blood of every
ancestor who fell in battle, every warrior whose line led to you. Their
fury mingles with yours, their strength becomes yours. Pain becomes fuel.
When you charge, you are no longer alone. Unseen hands guide your weapon.
Ancient rage amplifies your fury. The blood-price paid transforms you into
something more than mortal, and when you crash into your enemy trailing
crimson, they face not just you, but the weight of every bloodline warrior
who demands vengeance through your hands.
Blood demands blood. The ancestors accept no other currency.
Using this skill generates two points of fury.

Help on skill:     Danger sense
Usage duration:    automatic
Skill type:        defensive
Affecting stat(s): strength and fury level
Death teaches quickly. Survive enough battles and something primal awakens
within: not thought, not technique, but pure predatory awareness. The kind
of instinct that keeps apex predators alive in their brutal world.
Where trained warriors analyze and calculate, the barbarian simply knows.
The shift in air pressure before a blade falls. The tensing of muscle
before a spell unleashes. The body moves before the mind registers the
threat, erupting away from danger with the explosive violence of a cornered
beast.
Others call it luck. Those who possess it know better. This is what happens
when fury and survival instinct m
erge into something beyond mere skill. When
one has danced with death so often that its approach is recognized by scent
alone.
And when death's strike misses? That's when the predator strikes back.

Skill type:        passive
Affecting stat(s): constitution, fury level, stupor and skill percent
There are moments when the fury burning in barbarian veins refuses to be
contained, even when the body is battered and stunned. Berserker rage does
not bow to pain or exhaustion - it feeds on them. When lesser warriors
would fall helpless, barbarian fury erupts in a defiant roar that shatters
whatever forces seek to bind.
This primal surge of adrenaline breaks the stunned free and momentarily
dulls pain, allowing the fight to continue when others would fall.

Trained fighters pace themselves. They calculate. They measure each strike,
conserving energy for prolonged combat. The barbarian does not.
There comes a moment when control becomes a luxury you cannot afford, when
the only path to victory is through overwhelming, relentless violence. Your
weapon becomes a blur. One strike flows into the next without pause, without
thought, without mercy. Again. Again. Again. A cascade of steel that gives
no quarter, no moment to recover, no breath to defend.
This is not fighting - this is drowning your enemy in brutality. They cannot
block all the strikes. Cannot dodge every blow. Cannot distinguish where one
attack ends and the next begins. By the time the storm passes, they stand
bleeding from wounds they never saw coming, their defense shattered by the
sheer impossible speed of savage fury.
Civilization teaches restraint. The frenzy teaches victory.
Using this skill costs five points of fury.

Affecting stat(s): constitution, strength, skill percent, leadership and inner

Reputation intimidates. Scars intimidate. But a true Warbringer projects
menace as something more tangible, more immediate. It radiates from your
scarred flesh, your unwavering stance, the cold certainty in your eyes that
says you have seen death a thousand times and sent it away disappointed.
When you consciously channel this aura, enemies hesitate. Their strikes
falter. They pull back at the last moment. They aim for less vital spots,
not from mercy, but from primal fear. The kind that makes prey reconsider
attacking a predator. This is not magic. This is pure, distilled menace
given form, making you a fortress that enemies batter themselves against
with decreasing conviction.
Using this skill costs three points of fury.

Death comes for everyone. Most warriors accept this inevitability when
wounds become too grave, when blood loss becomes too severe. A Warbringer
knows better. Even when your body screams for mercy, when blood pools at
your feet, when enemies smell victory, you have one final refusal left.
Drawing upon reserves you did not know existed, fueled by pure stubborn
defiance, you plant your feet and declare: not yet. Not here. Not to you.
Your wounds seem to matter less. Your armor feels heavier on their weapons
than on your shoulders. Your body remembers how to mend itself even as you
fight. This is what separates the Warbringer from ordinary warriors.
Everyone can fight when fresh. You fight hardest when you should already
be dead.
Using this skill costs three points of fury.

Usage duration:    automatic
Skill type:        passive
Affecting stat(s): strength and skill percent
Civilized warriors falter when their strikes miss. They adjust, recalculate,
hesitate. The barbarian does not. Each dodge teaches. Each parry reveals.
Each tumbling escape maps the enemy's patterns. Failure is not setback - it
is reconnaissance written in the language of violence.
Where others see frustration in a blocked strike, the savage sees opening.
That sidestep showed weight distribution. That parry revealed reach and
reaction speed. That tumble displayed timing. The prey has shown its dance,
and predators learn fast.
The next strike comes differently - heavier, faster, from an unexpected
angle. Techniques that worked moments ago suddenly fail. The barbarian
adapts with brutal efficiency, overwhelming defensive patterns through raw
physical dominance and learned advantage.
Miss once, twice - it matters not. The barbarian will overpower.

Civilized armies march in silence, maintaining discipline and formation.
They believe noise weakens strategy. Fools. The primal tribes know what
those orderly ranks have forgotten: sound itself i s a weapon. Not words,
not commands - raw, inhuman, bone-shaking fury given voice.
Your roar is not merely loud. It carries physical force, reverberating
through enemy bodies like a shockwave. Ears ring. Vision blurs. The
confident warrior who stood ready a heartbeat ago now staggers, their
certainty shattered by the primal reminder that they are prey, and you
are predator.
Where the enemy hears terror, your allies hear something else: the call
to war. The sound that says the hunt has begun. Their own fury rises to
match yours.
The roar is older than language, more honest than steel.

Combat instructors teach balance. Maintain your guard. Never overcommit.
Protect yourself while attacking. The barbarian rejects this philosophy
entirely. There are moments when caution is cowardice, when defense is
delay, when the only path forward is through absolute, reckless violence.
Throw aside every lesson about protection. Abandon guard. Overextend.
Commit everything, body, weapon, fury itself, into one devastating strike
delivered with such overwhelming force that the enemy's defense becomes
meaningless. Let them see the opening you create. Let them understand what's
coming. It changes nothing.
This is not technique or strategy. This is the moment when you decide that
killing your enemy matters more than your own safety, and you make that
decision with steel and fury. Either they fall or you do.
Civilized warriors fight to survive. The barbarian fights to kill.
Using this skill generates two points of fury.

Help on skill:     Relentless
Usage duration:    automatic
Skill type:        passive
Affecting stat(s): constitution, stamina and skill percent
The barbarian way is one of endless endurance. Where civilized warriors
tire and falter, the barbarian presses on. Where others must rest and
recover, the hunt continues. This is not mere stubbornness - it is a
fundamental truth of existence. Pain is temporary, exhaustion is weakness,
and surrender is death.
The body forged through countless trials becomes an instrument of relentless
warfare. Recovery from exertion comes faster than normal warriors, and
actions frequently cost less stamina. The longer a battle extends, the more
the advantage grows as weaker opponents exhaust themselves while the
barbarian presses on with unyielding determination.

Affecting stat(s): strength, constitution, attack, anatomy, spot weakness and

Trained soldiers retreat when wounded. Tactical withdrawal, they call it.
Strategic repositioning. The berserker knows what they refuse to admit:
these are just polite words for cowardice.
You do not retreat. You do not reposition. You advance. Always forward,
never back. Arrows find you? Advance. Spells strike you? Advance. The
enemy lands a perfect blow that should drop you? Absorb it and advance.
Pain is temporary. Momentum is survival. To stop moving forward is to
acknowledge your enemy as a threat worth avoiding.
Every impact you take feeds the rage. Every wound makes you more dangerous,
not less. Where civilized warriors see injury and think of healing, you see
fuel for the fury that propels you into striking range. By the time you
reach your enemy, you have transformed their attacks into your own power.
The berserker does not stop. The berserker arrives.

Swordmasters practice clean cuts. Precise. Elegant. Minimal damage for
maximum effect, they claim. The barbarian understands what they refuse to
see: elegance is weakness. Your enemy doesn't need a clean death. They
need to be ruined. To be bled out.
You don't simply cut. You rend. The initial strike is just the beginning.
As your weapon bites deep, you twist. Wrench. Turn a wound into catastrophe.
Muscle tears away from bone. Tendons snap like rotted rope. What was a
functional body becomes a ruin of separated parts still attached by stubborn
threads of tissue.
Where civilized fighters aim for quick kills, you aim for devastation. Your
enemy will not just fall, they will break. Not just die, they will be
torn apart. The difference between striking and rending is the difference
between injury and destruction.
What was whole becomes ruined. This is the barbarian way.
Using this skill costs five or more points of fury.

Civilized warriors respect distance. They maneuver cautiously, close gaps
with measured steps, maintain defensive posture while advancing. This is
what cowards call tactics. The savage knows better: distance is an illusion
that exists only for those too weak to shatter it.
Fury demands blood now. Not after careful positioning. Not when the tactical
situation favors it. Now. You explode forward with the momentum of an
avalanche, closing impossible gaps in heartbeats, weapon raised, the roar
of your charge announcing what your enemy already knows: running is futile.
The impact when you arrive is not combat, it is collision. They prepared
to fight, but you don't fight at distance. You arrive like a force of
nature and obliterate whatever stands before you. By the time they register
you've moved, your weapon has already found them.
Distance is a courtesy. The savage extends no courtesies.

The spirits of the wild do not merely offer strength. They offer insight,
clarity, wisdom that predates civilization itself. Through your deep
connection with the spiritual realm, you can channel collective wisdom of
nature, sharing this clarity with your allies.
When you open yourself as a conduit, spiritual energy flows through you
and into your companions. Their minds become sharper, their senses keener,
their abilities enhanced by this touch of the otherworld. They see threats
more clearly and perceive weaknesses that would otherwise remain hidden.
This is the gift of the Savage to their party: not just physical might,

Ancient tribes knew what civilized warriors have forgotten: symbols have
power. Not through magic, but through connection. When you paint mystical
patterns across your face and body using sacred pigments, you connect to
primal forces: the fury of predators, the endurance of stone, the cunning
of the hunter. As paint dries upon your skin, you feel the power of your
ancestors flowing through sacred symbols.
The patterns are many, each channeling different aspects of the primal
world. Some enhance physical might or resilience, others sharpen combat
instincts or bring fortune in battle. The choice of pattern reflects your

Battlefield chaos needs an anchor. Your allies need guidance, strength,
a rallying point for their courage. You provide this through the ancient
tradition of the war shout: a primal battle cry that resonates with power,
stirring the hearts of your companions and striking fear into enemies.
When you unleash your war cry, those who fight beside you feel renewed
vigor. Their strikes hit harder, their armor feels stronger, their resolve
hardens. This is battlefield leadership at its essence. Not commands, but
inspiration made manifest through raw vocal force. The act of rallying your
warriors also feeds your own fury, preparing you for carnage to come. This
is how the Warbringer leads: from the front, with strength that lifts all
who follow.
Using this skill generates three points of fury.
